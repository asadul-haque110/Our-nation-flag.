# Bangladesh Flag with HTML & CSS

This project demonstrates how to create the **flag of Bangladesh** using only HTML and CSS — no images.

## Flag Specifications
According to the official specifications:
- **Aspect ratio:** 3:5 (height:width)
- **Background color:** Dark green (#006a4e)
- **Red disc:** Diameter = 2/5 of the flag’s width (40%)
- **Disc center position:** Slightly toward the hoist — 45% of the width from the left edge, and vertically centered.

## Features
- **Pure CSS implementation** (no images used)
- **Responsive design** using `aspect-ratio`
- **Accessible**: Includes `aria-label` descriptions
- **Light styling** with shadow and rounded corners for presentation

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. The flag will scale responsively based on the viewport.

## Example
The flag is displayed as:
- A green rectangle with a 3:5 ratio.
- A red disc positioned slightly to the left of center.

## Screenshot
(You can add a screenshot of the rendered flag here.)
